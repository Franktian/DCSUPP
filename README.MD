# DCS Undergraduate Project Portal

This is the source code for the DCS Undergraduate Project Portal (DCSUPP). DCSUPP is a project-student matching platform developed by students from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto.

### 1. Project History

The DCS Undergraduate Project Portal started as a CSC 494 project supervised by Professor Francois Pitt and developed by Alan Yuan. The portal is intended to match research projects and undergraduate students. Before DCSUPP, the DCS department relied on a combination of the job discussion board, NSERC applications and mass professor to student email communications.

The lack of an organized communications system resulted in numerous research opportunities unfilled by undergraduate students. In addition, many students took research projects outside of their interests purely for the research credit.
