		<p> 
			The DCS Undergraduate Project Portal is a Student-Research Project matching 
			program developed by students from the Department of Computer Science at the University 
			of Toronto. 
		</p>

		<p>
			DCSUPP allows students to view and apply to projects. It also allows researchers and 
			professors to post projects. DCSUPP also includes project applications and project to 
			student matching. Our site reuses application information as much as possible to user 
			experience.
